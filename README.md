#BeaconFinder - Find beacons in files
This tool is intended to be used to find "beacons" - that is things that occur
at regular intervals. This is useful when performing a whole host of data
analytics tasks. The initial push is to allow this tool to manipulate Bro log files.
In the future, it will be updated to allow for many different file types.
